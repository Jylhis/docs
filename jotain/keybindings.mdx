## Navigation conventions

Jotain uses Emacs standard conventions throughout. The keybindings above are additions or remaps on top of the standard Emacs defaults.

- `C-` = Control
- `M-` = Meta (Alt)
- `S-` = Shift
- `s-` = Super (Windows/Command key)

Consult (`C-x b`, `C-s`, etc.) and Vertico are used for minibuffer completion. `M-.` / `M-,` invoke Eglot for LSP-aware navigation when a language server is active.
