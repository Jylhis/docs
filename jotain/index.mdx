Jotain is a modern, modular Emacs configuration managed with Nix Flakes, emphasizing performance and reproducible development. It provides a complete development environment with LSP support, modern completion, Git integration, and sensible defaults — all pinned and reproducible.

## Features

- **Reproducible** — managed by a Nix Flake for consistent environments across machines
- **Modular** — configuration split into logical elisp modules for easy customization
- **Performant** — `early-init.el` optimized for fast startup; GC tuning and native compilation enabled
- **Integrated** — home-manager module for zero-friction installation and configuration
- **Comprehensive** — packages for development, writing, Git, and more, all managed by Nix
